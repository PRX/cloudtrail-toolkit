Description: A collection of utilities that integrate with CloudTrail

Resources:
  # This is an _organization sink_ custom EventBridge event bus. It's intended
  # to exist once within an AWS Organization (i.e., in a single region in a
  # single account).
  #
  # Relevant CloudTrail activity within the organization is expected to be sent
  # to this event bus. Generally this is done by creating rules on all default
  # event buses within the organization, which forward CloudTrail events from
  # all accounts and regions to this bus.
  #
  # Any tooling that responds to CloudTrail activity can subscribe to
  # the relevant events on this bus.
  #
  # This bus should always be called `CloudTrail-org-sink`, as that is what
  # the rules on all default buses expect.
